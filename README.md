# Data selection method for assessment of autonomous vehicles

## Dataset
### Data Summary
We primarily use BDD100K video, a large public self-driving dataset. This dataset contains 100,000 videos collected across the United States of America. Each video is about 40 seconds long and 30 frames per second. In this experiment, our goal is to select a subset of videos from the entire video dataset. The videos also include GPS and IMU data captured by cell phones. The metadata query from OpenStreet map service via GPS. Because some GPS positions from cell phones cannot be queried in Openstreet map, therefore out of 100,000 videos, 72,197 videos with metadata totaling 2,861,030 seconds were successfully extracted and provided!
